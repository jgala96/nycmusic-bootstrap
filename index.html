			<h4>Jay-Z and Beyonce Concert:Drunk In Love</h4>
			<p>Erotica, glamour, swagger, street cred, and finally, a peek at marriage and family bliss all came together during Beyonce and Jay Z’s “On the Run” tour, which opened in Miami’s Sun Life Stadium last night (June 25). It was over two hours of tightly choreographed showmanship that was timed to the second, alternating between the pair’s solo history, their collaborative hits and by duet versions of hits both have originally recorded with others.The sheer volume of material, coupled with the cinematic theme (more on that later) and Beyoncé’s jaw-dropping wardrobe changes made for a highly entertaining and impressive show that went from the glamorous to the profane. But it was also a rather detached show. Yes, there was more than enough of Mr. and Mrs. Carter to satisfy the crowd here; those on the floor level, at least, never sat down and sang or rapped along to every single song, not missing even a beat of Jay’s raps. And these two enjoy the privilege of being some of the few acts that seem to appeal equally to male and female fans. But despite the obvious adulation, the lines between performers and audience were very sharply delineated and both Jay and Beyoncé’s were careful to adhere to script and procedure every step of the way.If there was no room for error, there wasn’t room either for spontaneity or audience interaction in this very finely tuned performance where one song bled seamlessly into the other, with brief musical interludes or snippets of film serving as transitions.
			</p>
			<p>The song's music video was directed by Hype Williams and shot in black-and-white in Golden Beach, Florida at a beach front manse. The visual, which features scenes of the pair singing the song together, received praise by critics for its sexual nature and simplicity. "Drunk in Love" was performed by Beyoncé and Jay-Z at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards. </p>
